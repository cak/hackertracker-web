[{"conference":"DEFCON32","timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","link":"","description":"Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years. Please be patient. All of the times listed here are **approximate**. \r\n\r\n# Basics\r\n\r\n### Who needs a badge?\r\n\r\nA badge is required for each human age 8 and older.\r\n\r\n### Human?\r\n\r\nYou are a human if you do not know otherwise. People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (infobooth). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until July 5, 2024, at 21:00 US/Pacific. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon. Your caretaker will receive a paper badge that will permit them to accompany you everywhere you go.\r\n\r\n# Still need help?\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about anything regarding human registration that are not addressed here, please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":133,"conference":"DEFCON32","updated_at":"2024-06-16T20:51+0000","color":"#9e33ca","name":"Misc","id":46362},"title":"Human Registration Open","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1723417200,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"Our human registration process this year will be very similar to previous years.

People that are not humans include goons, official speaker, village/community/contest/creator staff, press, black badge holders, or similar. If you are not a human, you need to register separately. If you don't know how, see an NFO goon (infobooth). The remainder of this message applies only to humans.\r\n\r\n### Lines? Linecon?\r\n\r\nLinecon is your optional opportunity to stand (or sit) in line for human registration to open. Doors will open for linecon on Wednesday at approximately 17:00. When human registration opens on Thursday at approximately 08:00, they start working the linecon queue, and the line will start moving quickly. (Please understand that we will begin processing the line on Thursday morning as soon as the cashiers and materials are in place; we will strive for Thursday 08:00, but actual start may be slightly earlier or later.)\r\n\r\nOnline badge purchase (aka pre-registration) has no impact on linecon. You can join the line on Wednesday (if you wish) regardless of whether you purchased a badge online or intend to pay with cash. There is only one linecon for both types of badge sales. \r\n\r\nPlease help us make this a great experience for everyone by **following directions given by goons**. After human registration opens, there may be one line for all of registration, or there may be two lines (one for online sales (pre-registration) and one for cash sales). This may also change over time, based on available staffing and necessary crowd control. We will strive to make it easily understandable in-person as to which line you should join. \r\n\r\n# Ways to buy a badge\r\n\r\n- $480 [online purchase](https://shop.defcon.org/products/def-con-32-las-vegas-convention-center) until July 5, 2024, at 21:00 US/Pacific. Tickets are transferable. Please read the details on the linked page.\r\n- $460 cash purchase on-site.\r\n- As part of a BlackHat registration.\r\n\r\n### Online Purchase\r\n\r\nYou will be emailed a QR code to the email address provided when you bought your badge. Please guard that QR code as though it is cash -- it can only be redeemed once, and anyone can redeem it if they have it (including a photo of it). Badges are picked-up on-site -- they will not be mailed or shipped.\r\n\r\nWe can scan the QR code either from your phone's display or from a printed copy. You **must** have the QR code with you in order to obtain your badge. As you approach the front of the line, if you are going to show your QR code on an electronic device, please ensure that your display is set to maximum brightness. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-registered, but ultimately are unable to attend DEF CON and want to cancel your purchase, the **only** way to get a refund is from the original online source. We are unable to provide any refunds on-site at DEF CON. There is a fee to have your badge canceled: $34 until July 15, and $84 on and after July 15.\r\n\r\nOnline purchases are provided a receipt via email when the purchase is made.\r\n\r\nOnline purchase -- often referred to as pre-registration -- does not allow you to skip any line/queue to pick up your badge. Once you arrive on-site, you will need to join the existing line for human registration. There may or may not be a dedicated line for pre-registration badge pickup, depending on when you arrive, how long the line is, available staff, etc.\r\n\r\n### Cash Purchase\r\n\r\nBadges will be available for purchase on-site at DEF CON. All badge sales are **cash only**. No checks, money orders, credit cards, etc., will be accepted. In order to keep the registration line moving as quickly as possible, please have **exact change** ready as you near the front of the line.\r\n\r\nThere are no refunds given for cash sales. If you have any doubt about your desire to buy a badge, please refrain from doing so.\r\n\r\nWe are unable to provide printed receipts at the time of the sale. A generic receipt for the cash sale of a badge will be made available on media.defcon.org after the conference. You are welcome to print your own copy of the receipt on plain paper.\r\n\r\n### Via BlackHat \r\n\r\nIf you attend BlackHat, it is possible to purchase a DEF CON badge with your BlackHat registration. If you did so, please get your DEF CON badge from BlackHat before they close. \r\n\r\n# Misc\r\n\r\nWant to buy multiple badges? No problem! We're happy to sell you however many badges you want to pay for.\r\n\r\nIf you lose your badge, there is unfortunately no way for us to replace it. You'll have to buy a replacement at full price. Please don't lose your badge. :( \r\n\r\nIf you are being accompanied by a full-time caretaker (such as someone who will push your wheelchair, and will accompany you at all times), please ask to speak to a Registration Goon.
