The OWASP MASTG is a comprehensive and open source guide about mobile security testing for both iOS and Android and offers a methodology and very detailed, technical test cases for penetration testers to ensure completeness and the latest attack techniques against mobile apps.At the beginning of the first day we start by giving an overview of the Android Platform and it’s Security Architecture. It is no longer mandatory for students to bring their own Android device, instead a cloud-based virtualized Android device will be provided for each student, by using Corellium. Topics include:- Frida crash course to kick-start with dynamic instrumentation on Android apps- Intercepting network traffic of apps written in mobile app frameworks such as Google’s Flutter- Identifying and exploiting a real word Deep-link vulnerability- Explore the differences and effectiveness of Reverse Engineering Android Apps through patching Smali, Xposed and Dynamic Instrumentation with Frida- Analyze Local Storage of an Android App- Usage of dynamic Instrumentation with Frida to:- bypass Frida detection mechanisms- bypass multiple root detection mechanismsOn day 2 we are focusing on iOS and will begin with an overview of the iOS Platform and Security Architecture. After explaining what an IPA container is and the iOS file system structure, we start creating an iOS testing environment with Corellium and deep dive into various topics, including:- Analyzing iOS applications that use non-HTTP traffic including ways of intercepting the traffic- Frida crash course to kick-start with dynamic instrumentation for iOS apps- Bypassing SSL Pinning with SSL Kill Switch and Objection (Frida)- Testing methodology with a non-jailbroken device by repackaging an IPA with the Frida Gadget- Using Frida for Runtime Instrumentation of iOS Apps to bypass:- Anti-Jailbreaking mechanisms- Frida detection mechanism- and other client-side security controlsAt the end of each day a CTF will be played to investigate two apps with the newly learned skills and you can win a prize!Whether you are a beginner interested in learning mobile app testing from scratch or an experienced professional who would like to enhance their existing skills to perform more advanced attack techniques, or for fun, this training will help you accomplish your goals.The course consists of many different labs developed by the trainer and the course is roughly 65% hands-on and 35% lecture.After successful completion of this course, students will have a better understanding of how to test for vulnerabilities in mobile apps, how to propose the right mitigation techniques to developers and how to execute tests consistently.\n\n\n","title":"2-Day Training: Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) - Hands-On (AVAILABLE IN PERSON OR VIRTUALLY)","type":{"conference_id":126,"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","updated_at":"2023-10-29T03:22+0000","color":"#9edf7d","name":"2-Day Training","id":46036},"android_description":"**NOTE:A SEPARATE TICKET PURCHASE IS NEEDED TO ATTEND OWASP TRAINING COURSES.

The training is a glued-to-your-keyboard hands-on journey with labs that are backed by practical examples of DevSecOps and AppSec Automation.The Training starts with a view of DevSecOps and AppSec Automation, specifically in terms of embedding security activities in multiple stages of the Software Development Lifecycle. Subsequently, the training delves into specific Application Security Automation approaches for SAST, SCA and Supply-Chain Security, DAST and Integration of these tools into CI/CD tools and Automation Pipelines.In this edition, we’re completely rebuilding our existing DevSecOps content to reflect the very bleeding edge of Application Security Automation and DevSecOps Approaches. These include, but not limited to:Hands-on SAST for Apps and Infrastructure-as-Code, with a focus on Semgrep and CodeQL. Develop Custom SAST rules like a bawse!Supply-Chain Security Automation: SBOMs, Source Composition Analysis and Security Engineering techniques. This segment will additionally have several approaches to building secure base images for containersSupply-Chain Assurance and Provenance for artifacts. Supply-Chain Security attacks are largely caused by lack of assurance and poor provenance of software supply-chain artifacts. We’ll be diving into the SLSA (Supply-Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) Standard and how automation can help achieve levels of compliance. In addition we’ll be diving into Cosign from Project sigstore. This can be used to generate keyed/keyless signatures for container images and other build artifacts including packages and SBOMs. Secret Management - This segment of the class will dive into Secrets Management and Encryption tools like Hashicorp Vault. This will have examples of advanced implementations for Encryption, Key Management and Dynamic SecretsDAST Automation with OWASP ZAP and Nuclei. We’ll be exploring API based scanning with OWASP ZAP and Test Automation Frameworks. In addition, we’ll explore using and building custom DAST automation with Nuclei. This will not only aid in integrating DAST into Automation Pipelines, but also be used for Security Regressions for more complex vulnerabilitiesPolicy-As-Code with Open Policy-Agent (OPA). OPA is a powerful framework that can be used to create and enforce policies across a variety of deployment environments. From being used to perform Access Control and Input Validation in API Gateways, to be used in Container Registries and Operating Systems for deploying and enforcing security policies. You’ll learn OPA’s Domain Specific Language, rego in order to understand policy-as-code frameworks. Integrating Security Automation with CI/CD tooling. Here we’ll be exploring integrating Security Automation with CI/CD tools including Github Actions, Gitlab and Jenkins. In addition, we’ll be leveraging Data Flow Automation tools like Robot Framework, Gaia and Prefect to provide alternatives to typical CI/CD tools for AppSec Automation. Each section of the training will contain a challenge section that will enable the trainees and the trainers to identify levels of student learningParticipants get a 2 month access to our online lab environment for DevSecOps training\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":126,"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","updated_at":"2023-10-29T03:22+0000","color":"#9edf7d","name":"2-Day Training","id":46036},"title":"2 Day Training:AppSec Automation Masterclass (AVAILABLE IN PERSON OR VIRTUALLY)","android_description":"**NOTE:A SEPARATE TICKET PURCHASE IS NEEDED TO ATTEND OWASP TRAINING COURSES.

The OWASP MASTG is a comprehensive and open source guide about mobile security testing for both iOS and Android and offers a methodology and very detailed, technical test cases for penetration testers to ensure completeness and the latest attack techniques against mobile apps.At the beginning of the first day we start by giving an overview of the Android Platform and it’s Security Architecture. It is no longer mandatory for students to bring their own Android device, instead a cloud-based virtualized Android device will be provided for each student, by using Corellium. Topics include:- Frida crash course to kick-start with dynamic instrumentation on Android apps- Intercepting network traffic of apps written in mobile app frameworks such as Google’s Flutter- Identifying and exploiting a real word Deep-link vulnerability- Explore the differences and effectiveness of Reverse Engineering Android Apps through patching Smali, Xposed and Dynamic Instrumentation with Frida- Analyze Local Storage of an Android App- Usage of dynamic Instrumentation with Frida to:- bypass Frida detection mechanisms- bypass multiple root detection mechanismsOn day 2 we are focusing on iOS and will begin with an overview of the iOS Platform and Security Architecture. After explaining what an IPA container is and the iOS file system structure, we start creating an iOS testing environment with Corellium and deep dive into various topics, including:- Analyzing iOS applications that use non-HTTP traffic including ways of intercepting the traffic- Frida crash course to kick-start with dynamic instrumentation for iOS apps- Bypassing SSL Pinning with SSL Kill Switch and Objection (Frida)- Testing methodology with a non-jailbroken device by repackaging an IPA with the Frida Gadget- Using Frida for Runtime Instrumentation of iOS Apps to bypass:- Anti-Jailbreaking mechanisms- Frida detection mechanism- and other client-side security controlsAt the end of each day a CTF will be played to investigate two apps with the newly learned skills and you can win a prize!Whether you are a beginner interested in learning mobile app testing from scratch or an experienced professional who would like to enhance their existing skills to perform more advanced attack techniques, or for fun, this training will help you accomplish your goals.The course consists of many different labs developed by the trainer and the course is roughly 65% hands-on and 35% lecture.After successful completion of this course, students will have a better understanding of how to test for vulnerabilities in mobile apps, how to propose the right mitigation techniques to developers and how to execute tests consistently.\n\n\n","type":{"conference_id":126,"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","updated_at":"2023-10-29T03:22+0000","color":"#9edf7d","name":"2-Day Training","id":46036},"title":"2-Day Training: Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG) - Hands-On (AVAILABLE IN PERSON OR VIRTUALLY)","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1698872400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"**NOTE:A SEPARATE TICKET PURCHASE IS NEEDED TO ATTEND OWASP TRAINING COURSES.

The training is a glued-to-your-keyboard hands-on journey with labs that are backed by practical examples of DevSecOps and AppSec Automation.The Training starts with a view of DevSecOps and AppSec Automation, specifically in terms of embedding security activities in multiple stages of the Software Development Lifecycle. Subsequently, the training delves into specific Application Security Automation approaches for SAST, SCA and Supply-Chain Security, DAST and Integration of these tools into CI/CD tools and Automation Pipelines.In this edition, we’re completely rebuilding our existing DevSecOps content to reflect the very bleeding edge of Application Security Automation and DevSecOps Approaches. These include, but not limited to:Hands-on SAST for Apps and Infrastructure-as-Code, with a focus on Semgrep and CodeQL. Develop Custom SAST rules like a bawse!Supply-Chain Security Automation: SBOMs, Source Composition Analysis and Security Engineering techniques. This segment will additionally have several approaches to building secure base images for containersSupply-Chain Assurance and Provenance for artifacts. Supply-Chain Security attacks are largely caused by lack of assurance and poor provenance of software supply-chain artifacts. We’ll be diving into the SLSA (Supply-Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) Standard and how automation can help achieve levels of compliance. In addition we’ll be diving into Cosign from Project sigstore. This can be used to generate keyed/keyless signatures for container images and other build artifacts including packages and SBOMs. Secret Management - This segment of the class will dive into Secrets Management and Encryption tools like Hashicorp Vault. This will have examples of advanced implementations for Encryption, Key Management and Dynamic SecretsDAST Automation with OWASP ZAP and Nuclei. We’ll be exploring API based scanning with OWASP ZAP and Test Automation Frameworks. In addition, we’ll explore using and building custom DAST automation with Nuclei. This will not only aid in integrating DAST into Automation Pipelines, but also be used for Security Regressions for more complex vulnerabilitiesPolicy-As-Code with Open Policy-Agent (OPA). OPA is a powerful framework that can be used to create and enforce policies across a variety of deployment environments.

We will cover the practical solutions we have to put in place to tackle this problem and manage the PCI requirements.By the end of this talk, attendees will have a better understanding of the challenges of managing and scaling frontend supply chain security solutions, as well as practical solutions to implement CSP and monitor web resources at scale.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1698546840,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":126,"event_ids":[53279],"name":"Jon Kulisz","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52090},{"conference_id":126,"event_ids":[53279],"name":"Piyush Pattanayak","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52105}],"timeband_id":1121,"links":[],"end":"2023-10-31T20:15:00.000-0000","id":53279,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1698780600,"nanoseconds":0},"tag_ids":[46041],"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46024,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52090},{"tag_id":46024,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52105}],"tags":"","conference_id":126,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":126,"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","updated_at":"2023-10-29T03:22+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Room: Capital-Congress","hotel":"","short_name":"Room: Capital-Congress","id":46069},"begin":"2023-10-31T19:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-10-29T02:34:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"Cloud providers have made significant progress in securing their infrastructure and data centers.

Such tools implement two distinctive styles of algorithms. The first one is structural. This is like advanced pattern matching and is also common in code-quality oriented tools. The second one is dataflow analysis, also known as taint analysis. In this case, the SAST tool tries to find paths between entry points of potential attacks, such as web request parameter, and program locations where such an attack could manifest itself, such as non-escaped SQL statements.While this is a tried-and-true approach for many important cases, such as Java and C# web applications, it’s no longer enough as we’re entering the “everything as code” era. As infrastructure becomes code (CloudFormation, Terraform, Bicep, etc.), contracts become code (Solidity, Viper), circuits become code (VHDL, Verilog), etc., all these things could potentially be analyzed using SAST technology. SAST users are seeing this potential and are demanding SAST providers to extend their offerings in this direction. However, doing so is not a straightforward extension of standard SAST functionality into new languages and libraries. Threat models are quite different. As it turns out, the differences are fundamental that the common notion of “taint analysis” isn’t particularly useful here. We’ll have a closer look at two cases to examine this in more detail.The first one is Bicep. This is Microsoft’s language for Infrastructure-as-Code in the Azure cloud. The main (but far from only) risk here is misconfiguration of infrastructure from a security perspective. Since it’s a rich language including functions, templates, parameters, etc., simple structural analysis will not suffice. Taint analysis isn’t very useful here. The core SAST algorithm required is constant propagation. It’s also an interesting case because Bicep is a declarative language whereas dataflow analysis algorithms generally assume an imperative language.Finally, there’s the aspect of Bicep/ARM interoperability that should be considered. The second case is Solidity. This is the most popular language to implement smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. While its syntax is Java-like, its semantics and threat model are radically different. Some of the things that a SAST tool should do for Solidity are different from other cases, but easy to implement (such as compiler version checks). But some other things pose a challenge: the analysis of some Solidity vulnerabilities hinges on a notion of “being influenced by” which has different propagation rules than “taint” in the classical case.

We think you’ll come away with an improved understanding of the modern SBOM landscape along with specific solutions you can use to elevate your organization’s SBOM program.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1698546840,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":126,"event_ids":[53273],"name":"Cortez Frazier Jr","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52067}],"timeband_id":1121,"links":[],"end":"2023-10-31T19:00:00.000-0000","id":53273,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1698776100,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46042],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46024,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52067}],"tags":"","conference_id":126,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":126,"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","updated_at":"2023-10-29T03:22+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Room: Treasury","hotel":"","short_name":"Room: Treasury","id":46073},"updated":"2023-10-29T02:34:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-10-31T18:15:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"Zero trust is all the rage.

This served as a ground to the current emerging attack vector - the software supply chain. The attackers goals did not change they are still attempting to stealing data and  infecting machines. The attacker tactics may be utilizing common attack techniques such as exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. However,  the technology, people, and culture of the software supply chain ecosystem have unique characteristics that require a distinct understanding and approach. The Open Software Supply Chain Attack Reference (OSC&R) is a new security framework that aims to address these issues and provide a common language for the software supply chain. In this talk, we will provide an in-depth exploration of the OSC&R model through real-world examples, including analyzing past attacks, assessing supply chain security posture, conducting tabletop exercises, and addressing incident response and crisis management.

This served as a ground to the current emerging attack vector - the software supply chain. The attackers goals did not change they are still attempting to stealing data and  infecting machines. The attacker tactics may be utilizing common attack techniques such as exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. However,  the technology, people, and culture of the software supply chain ecosystem have unique characteristics that require a distinct understanding and approach. The Open Software Supply Chain Attack Reference (OSC&R) is a new security framework that aims to address these issues and provide a common language for the software supply chain.

While Passwordless technologies are inherently more secure than traditional password-based authentication, there seems to be an overall idea of this technology being unhackable, and a perception that account takeover and user impersonation are not even possible when using it.  This talk will cover real-world risks and vulnerabilities of passwordless solutions for Web applications and how a faulty implementation can lead to a more significant security breach than when using passwords alone. We will see how as a consequence of an attacker managing to compromise the passwordless authentication, users will not have that tiny piece of protection preventing other people from accessing their details: ironically, a password.This talk will also cover the best practices for developers looking to integrate a passwordless mechanism (WebAuthn) into their Web application.

In her keynote address, Alyssa Miller will talk about perspectives gained and the true progress we’ve made since OWASP was founded in 2001. She’ll also examine the challenges we’ve yet to conquer. And most importantly, Alyssa will dive into the mistakes we’ve made along the way and how we can put those lessons to use as we attempt to move application security forward.

As the usage of these platforms becomes widespread, they all adopt some type of code reuse and code sharing mechanism using a marketplace approach. Whether it’s Forge for Outsystems, AppSource for Microsoft PowerApps or the UiPath Marketplace - all platforms adopted the concept of allowing app developers to get a head start (or completely rely on) by taking content created and publicly shared by other developers. Introducing applications that are based on marketplace components and templates exposes an enterprise to two types of threats: malicious (no) code and vulnerabilities.The first involves a threat actor that creates a component with intentional, undesired, functionality. The component is then placed into the marketplace by the threat actor. When developers introduce the malicious component / application into their LCNC environment the malicious functionality is executed in the context of enterprise permissions, providing the attacker internal access into data and machines. The second threat pertains to applications and components that were shared through the marketplace without thorough security review. These components contain security vulnerabilities and when introduced by developers into the organization’s LCNC environment expose enterprise data to these same vulnerabilities. The two threats are imminent in the LCNC domain as there are very few tools and practices for weaving out security vulnerabilities from no-code applications and even fewer to detect the existence of undesired, malicious, functionality.The session discusses and demonstrates our attempts to introduce vulnerable and malicious components into the marketplace of various LCNC platforms. We will show what worked and what didn’t and also discuss methods that could be used to overcome existing guardrails.

Overall, leveraging an APM environment for security insights can improve an organization's ability to detect and respond to security incidents, and ultimately enhance its overall security posture.","end_timestamp":{"seconds":1698682500,"nanoseconds":0},"updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1698546840,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":126,"event_ids":[53237],"name":"Rafael Ferreira","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52106}],"timeband_id":1120,"links":[],"end":"2023-10-30T16:15:00.000-0000","id":53237,"tag_ids":[46041],"village_id":null,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1698679800,"nanoseconds":0},"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46024,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52106}],"tags":"","conference_id":126,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":126,"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","updated_at":"2023-10-29T03:22+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Room: Capital-Congress","hotel":"","short_name":"Room: Capital-Congress","id":46069},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2023-10-30T15:30:00.000-0000","updated":"2023-10-29T02:34:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"In a world full of vulnerabilities, there is an untold story of those libraries that are insecure by design.

Not only will this newly outlined detail assist in the generation of test cases, but it will also provide context to the companies that seek testing against the ASVS so that they understand the effort required for that work.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1698546840,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":126,"event_ids":[53229],"name":"Shanni Prutchi","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"media":[],"id":52113}],"timeband_id":1120,"links":[],"end":"2023-10-30T15:15:00.000-0000","id":53229,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1698676200,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46039],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46024,"sort_order":1,"person_id":52113}],"tags":"","conference_id":126,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":126,"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","updated_at":"2023-10-29T03:22+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"Room: Archives","hotel":"","short_name":"Room: Archives","id":46068},"spans_timebands":"N","updated":"2023-10-29T02:34:00.000-0000","begin":"2023-10-30T14:30:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"OWASPGLOBAL2023","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"","description":"This talk will provide an in-depth exploration of the process of exploiting binary files and focuses on the outdated techniques used to exploit binary hardening in the past, the rise of binary hardening and the cutting edge exploiting techniques that developed to bypass them.
