Nos enfocaremos en las tácticas empleadas para desafiar y evaluar los sistemas de seguridad física existentes. La ingeniería social se convierte en una herramienta esencial para el red teamer. A través de la manipulación psicológica y la interacción con el personal, se busca ganar confianza y acceder a áreas restringidas. Esto puede incluir la suplantación de identidad, haciéndose pasar por un empleado legítimo o un contratista autorizado, o aprovechar situaciones cotidianas, como el ingreso durante la hora del almuerzo cuando la vigilancia puede ser menos estricta. La persuasión y el engaño también juegan un papel importante. El red teamer puede emplear técnicas de persuasión convincentes, como simular emergencias o presentarse como una autoridad que necesita acceso inmediato.

Nos enfocaremos en las tácticas empleadas para desafiar y evaluar los sistemas de seguridad física existentes. La ingeniería social se convierte en una herramienta esencial para el red teamer. A través de la manipulación psicológica y la interacción con el personal, se busca ganar confianza y acceder a áreas restringidas. Esto puede incluir la suplantación de identidad, haciéndose pasar por un empleado legítimo o un contratista autorizado, o aprovechar situaciones cotidianas, como el ingreso durante la hora del almuerzo cuando la vigilancia puede ser menos estricta. La persuasión y el engaño también juegan un papel importante. El red teamer puede emplear técnicas de persuasión convincentes, como simular emergencias o presentarse como una autoridad que necesita acceso inmediato. Además, el uso de dispositivos o herramientas especializadas, como llaves maestras falsas o herramientas de bypass, se utilizan para superar barreras físicas y desactivar sistemas de seguridad. Este resumen destaca cómo el red teaming y la ingeniería social pueden revelar las debilidades en la seguridad física de un edificio.

This proposal will shed light on the security issues surrounding fax machines in healthcare settings, discuss why hospitals still employ them, and explore the barriers they create for patients. We will also delve into the technical considerations and present alternative, secure communication methods. The persistence of fax machines in a healthcare setting can be attributed to historical norms and regulatory compliance. They are perceived as a secure means of transmitting sensitive patient information, though the reality is quite the opposite. Moreover, since faxes often sit in open communal areas, the risk of physical document theft is significant. The lack of encryption and secure authentication mechanisms further compounds these issues, potentially leading to patient data breaches. In 2019, a major healthcare provider in the U.S. inadvertently exposed 1.7 million patient records due to a fax server misconfiguration, illustrating the critical risks involved. Requiring patients to send records via fax creates a significant barrier to care, especially for those who lack access to fax machines or the technical know-how to use them. Patients, often already burdened with health concerns, face unnecessary hurdles in their healthcare journey. Real-life cases demonstrate how this can lead to delayed diagnoses, missed appointments, and suboptimal patient outcomes. The transition from traditional faxing to secure electronic communication methods in healthcare is a transformation that not only provides substantial business value and enhanced security but also brings pivotal improvements in patient care and outcomes. Secure messaging platforms, EHR integration, telemedicine solutions, and Health Information Exchange (HIE) messaging offer highly protected channels for sharing patient data. These alternatives streamline communication and enhance operational efficiency, ultimately leading to faster and more informed decision-making, which, in turn, improves patient care. The estimated benefits encompass cost savings, better resource utilization, and revenue growth, while simultaneously reducing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as HIPAA.

This proposal will shed light on the security issues surrounding fax machines in healthcare settings, discuss why hospitals still employ them, and explore the barriers they create for patients. We will also delve into the technical considerations and present alternative, secure communication methods. The persistence of fax machines in a healthcare setting can be attributed to historical norms and regulatory compliance. They are perceived as a secure means of transmitting sensitive patient information, though the reality is quite the opposite. Moreover, since faxes often sit in open communal areas, the risk of physical document theft is significant. The lack of encryption and secure authentication mechanisms further compounds these issues, potentially leading to patient data breaches. In 2019, a major healthcare provider in the U.S. inadvertently exposed 1.7 million patient records due to a fax server misconfiguration, illustrating the critical risks involved. Requiring patients to send records via fax creates a significant barrier to care, especially for those who lack access to fax machines or the technical know-how to use them. Patients, often already burdened with health concerns, face unnecessary hurdles in their healthcare journey. Real-life cases demonstrate how this can lead to delayed diagnoses, missed appointments, and suboptimal patient outcomes. The transition from traditional faxing to secure electronic communication methods in healthcare is a transformation that not only provides substantial business value and enhanced security but also brings pivotal improvements in patient care and outcomes. Secure messaging platforms, EHR integration, telemedicine solutions, and Health Information Exchange (HIE) messaging offer highly protected channels for sharing patient data. These alternatives streamline communication and enhance operational efficiency, ultimately leading to faster and more informed decision-making, which, in turn, improves patient care. The estimated benefits encompass cost savings, better resource utilization, and revenue growth, while simultaneously reducing the risk of data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as HIPAA. Administrative changes like user training, access control, consent management, and compliance measures are instrumental in reaping these advantages. This presentation will highlight how adopting these direct alternatives to legacy fax policies, healthcare organizations can fortify data protection, optimize workflows, and ensure their continued success and growth while also contributing to better patient care and outcomes.","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1709761800,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[{"conference_id":135,"event_ids":[54190],"name":"Raae Wolfram","affiliations":[],"links":[],"pronouns":null,"id":53499,"media":[{"hash_sha256":"4b3961205aec8814c0aa483ad623c303f93b774d2c0094ba4087140c8e4768d4","filetype":"image/webp","hash_md5":"c124ac60885aff2f6e4382faabefce13","name":"raae-wolfram.webp","hash_crc32c":"55cf938a","asset_id":504,"filesize":24856,"sort_order":1,"url":"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/hackertest-5a202.appspot.com/o/BSIDESPR2024%2Fraae-wolfram.webp?alt=media","person_id":53499}]}],"timeband_id":1153,"links":[],"end":"2024-04-13T14:50:00.000-0000","id":54190,"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1713018000,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"tag_ids":[46203],"includes":"","people":[{"tag_id":46204,"sort_order":1,"person_id":53499}],"tags":"","conference_id":135,"links_antiquated":[],"spans_timebands":"N","location":{"conference_id":135,"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","updated_at":"2024-03-06T22:21+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"104C","hotel":"","short_name":"104C","id":46187},"begin":"2024-04-13T14:20:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-03-06T21:50:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","timezone":"America/Puerto_Rico","link":"","description":"","title":"Break","type":{"conference_id":135,"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","color":"#33c756","updated_at":"2024-03-06T22:21+0000","name":"Misc","id":46216},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1713018000,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"","updated_timestamp":{"seconds":1709761560,"nanoseconds":0},"speakers":[],"timeband_id":1153,"links":[],"end":"2024-04-13T14:20:00.000-0000","id":54183,"tag_ids":[46216],"begin_timestamp":{"seconds":1713016500,"nanoseconds":0},"village_id":null,"includes":"","people":[],"tags":"","conference_id":135,"links_antiquated":[],"location":{"conference_id":135,"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","updated_at":"2024-03-06T22:21+0000","parent_id":0,"name":"104C-104B","hotel":"","short_name":"104C-104B","id":46186},"spans_timebands":"N","begin":"2024-04-13T13:55:00.000-0000","updated":"2024-03-06T21:46:00.000-0000"},{"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","timezone":"America/Puerto_Rico","link":"","description":"Raices Cyber was founded in August 2021 with the mission of empowering, encouraging, and supporting the Hispanic, Latino, Latina, and Latinx communities to achieve more representation in the cyber workforce.

Addressing the threat of ransomware presents significant challenges to organizations across various sectors. Organizations can track their ransomware resilience capabilities by mapping in-use compliance frameworks to ransomware mitigation; this process requires examining the differentiators in the levity of their respective controls. Furthermore, organizations need to analyze what insurance companies are asking – their questionnaires are meant to quantify their risk and one of their largest risks is ransomware. Lastly, the development of ransomware resilience aligns with identifying single points of failure, their compensating controls, and establishing effective testing metrics that align key controls with compliance requirements. Leveraging a Security Operations Center (SOC) to fortify ransomware resilience starts with enhancing SOC visibility and awareness. Utilizing a top-down approach to security governance, the SOC should maintain points of contact across departments and establish escalation criteria for specific types of incidents, including ransomware or precursors to ransomware. SOC communication and awareness of other departments allows for improved prioritization and hardening of specific users and/or systems, particularly in the context of insider threats. A SOC can make its largest impact on the augmentation of ransomware resilience through the use of proactive intelligence and reactive testing. Threat intelligence feeds allow a SOC to gain a better understanding of who might be targeting their infrastructure, and what TTPs they are likely to use. This data should inform organizational detection and response capabilities. Threat hunting can utilize threat intelligence based on historical attack patterns, or prevalent vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild. The SOC is informed on what to hunt for based on attack patterns being seen and alerts being responded to. When carried out strategically, these hunts can be used to obtain further threat intelligence, and in turn improve detection and response capabilities. Validate detection and response capabilities with purple team testing. The concept of a purple team emerges from the integration of red and blue team activities, focusing on bridging the gap between offensive and defensive cybersecurity practices. Specifically, purple team exercises can ensure that specific activities, usually based on real threat actors, are being alerted on and the alerts are triggered correctly within the proper amount of time. Lastly, it is imperative that a SOC is a stakeholder in the organization’s communicated and tested incident response plan. Running tabletop exercises using the incident response plan and potentially other runbooks allows for a more cohesive and faster reaction in the event of a ransomware incident.\n\n\n","title":"Leveraging SOC Capabilities to Build Ransomware Resilience","type":{"conference_id":135,"conference":"BSIDESPR2024","color":"#19A8B0","updated_at":"2024-03-06T22:21+0000","name":"Talk","id":46203},"end_timestamp":{"seconds":1712948400,"nanoseconds":0},"android_description":"This presentation will discuss a comprehensive approach to enhance an organization's ability to prevent and withstand ransomware attacks by utilizing SOC capabilities, thereby minimizing their impact.
